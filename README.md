# Deep-Learning-Self-Driving-Car
Carla Self driving car tutorial

This is a folder where I store my samples of code concerning deep learning and breeding agents to learn how to drive in CARLA environment.

The first series (CARLA_SDC) are based on the tutorial of Sentdex. 

The second series (CARLA_BRAX) are based on my own exploration of the CARLA environment.
